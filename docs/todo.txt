- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size




- cells next to resume on direct address navigation are greyed out.

- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- ie 11...thick borders on some cells are messed up




- firefox tries to keep loading something in embedded portfolio & resume




- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
