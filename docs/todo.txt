- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size


- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)




- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes, instead of recompiling client like before

- fix bottom-right tags in resume

- have thumb building script work for all images

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell

- fix source code generation for splash+compiled cells and single image cells

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization





- firefox tries to load something with cells with iframes

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
