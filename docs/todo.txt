- have hud disappear to the top

- put thumbnails on a sprite plate...when refreshHomeCells have to iterate topleft-to bottomright and give cells an index then use that index mod 10 or whatever to get position in sprite plate

- still have to catch image load for removed element...not happy with that not being caught...do test with plain javascript so i can post to issue tracker.....hmm might be that setcode queue is the issue...might have to get fancier with meta preloading

- fix flashing of canvas backing when zooming out real fast

- read about new injection format, if it's much better make a sample app and see how it's done

- snap to canvas wrapping after a hard refresh...notice white flash of nearby cells (works with other cells too, but need hard refresh)...actually doesn't need snap...when solution is 

- see if imagesLoaded handles setting to one image then setting to another image...do we get two callbacks?

- see if we can bring meta filesize down a bit without quality impact...some of them are approaching a meg in size

- see what that cache_miss thing is about





- perhaps have delay for actually showing the cell_1 loading animation...so for .5 seconds or whatever it's invisible then fades in real quick...this is to limit the jarring effect it has for most of the time when it's just appearing for a brief instant before the code is retrieved from server...on the same token meta cells won't behave like this...they always have to show loading animation 

- still seems like on mobile that loaded cell_1s go white when you zoom out to cell_2/4/whatever...might be fixed now that meta doesn't use gpu






- double-chcek gpu usage

- see if modifying display triggers reflow....see how many reflows per update we're doing...should just be one







- logical argument to esp

- update resume





- do something about going past (e.g.) meta_4 too fast over and over and having the canvas backing still always showing.

- perhaps if the target cell for a snap from a meta level is the default width/height then the meta image slowly fades out to counter the flash that occurs when the target cell has to load for the first time as a result of the snap.

- spinner lagged behind behind scroll at some point pretty significantly on Android...may be better since a lot of things changed there.

- hud appears fine and animates well before cells and focuser appear when going going between history states with different app sessions

- make it so focused spinner doesn't go off the bottom or right when all the way scrolled over with a really thin window...make it behave kinda like the cell hud does when it's totally collapsed down...kinda ghosts along the opposite direction of the scroll

- canvas backing scrolls with focused cell...not really a concern for now cause backing isn't visible under normal circumstances...only for debug for now

- maybe use some sparse int-key-based hashmap for getCellAtAbsCoord

- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)



- rewrite simple urls to their long ones

- 


- oar main picture is out of focus

- don't capture all touches for pressure

- first pressure has effect/affect typo

- slider doesn't work in decay for android or something.

- fix image caching for pressure, maybe decay

- snow flake ripples more pronounced



- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes and building app

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell's code

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization

- detect platform capability (through fps or something) and accordingly skip meta levels and/or use lower rez meta images

- hud slightly too short on mobile browsers...no idea why...hacked for now to do mobile check but it don't make sense



- firefox tries to continuously load (at least showing favicon spinner) something for cells with iframes
