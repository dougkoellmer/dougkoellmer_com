- see how fading out the topmost layer looks when we're snapping...either that or topmost layer needs to be at a z-index higher than focused cell when on death row...yea that might work instead...and make sure buffer takes into account that perhaps topmost layer failed to load, so a meta cell layer underneath that is loaded needs to take over this duty

- have hud disappear to the top

- try fading cells while on death row

- make sure onMEtaImageLoaded can't come in after the cell has been reused for another coordinate

- integrate latest state machine

- stagger "in-memory" meta cells




- still seems like on mobile that loaded cell_1s go white when you zoom out to cell_2/4/whatever




- double-chcek gpu usage

- see if modifying display triggers reflow....see how many reflows per update we're doing...should just be one





- "grand_ideas" cell with insurance replacement, new democracy, and toll road

- logical argument to esp

- update resume







- spinner lagged behind behind scroll at some point pretty significantly on Android...may be better since a lot of things changed there.

- hud appears fine and animates well before cells and focuser appear when going going between history states with different app sessions

- perhaps somehow keep meta cells in buffer if there is a problem loading the meta cells or cell_1's underneath?

- perhaps correctly z-order meta cells on kill queue that are over a cell_1...for now they're all piled together at the same z index...not a big deal though

- make it so focused spinner doesn't go off the bottom or right when all the way scrolled over with a really thin window...make it behave kinda like the cell hud does when it's totally collapsed down...kinda ghosts along the opposite direction of the scroll

- canvas backing scrolls with focused cell...not really a concern for now cause backing isn't visible under normal circumstances...only for debug for now

- maybe use some sparse int-key-based hashmap for getCellAtAbsCoord

- delay hud zoom animation until cell is visible

- don't remove visual cell until it's done animating if it's still on screen

- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)



- rewrite simple urls to their long ones

- 


- oar main picture is out of focus

- don't capture all touches for pressure

- first pressure has effect/affect typo

- slider doesn't work in decay for android or something.

- fix image caching for pressure, maybe decay

- snow flake ripples more pronounced



- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes and building app

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell's code

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization

- detect platform capability (through fps or something) and accordingly skip meta levels and/or use lower rez meta images

- hud slightly too short on mobile browsers...no idea why...hacked for now to do mobile check but it don't make sense



- firefox tries to continuously load (at least showing favicon spinner) something for cells with iframes
