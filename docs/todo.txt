- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size





- firefox tries to keep loading something in embedded portfolio & resume, probably analytics




- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
