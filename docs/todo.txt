- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size


- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)


- implict cell focused size option
-	optimize event handlers to not recalc layout unless buffer cell's cellSize has natural dimension
-	fix natural dimension calculation on direct browser navigation
-	test for extreme resize cases
-	cell hud isn't positioned correctly...not handling the "cell appeared" event correctly or something
-	hud is one pixel too large or one pixel too far over for its smallest size when totally scrolled right
-	forward history button doesn't work anymore



- don't capture all touches for pressure

- first pressure as effect/affect typo

- slider doesn't work in decay for android or something.

- fix image caching for pressure, maybe decay



- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes and building app

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization




- firefox tries to load something with cells with iframes

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
