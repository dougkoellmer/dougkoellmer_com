- support larger focused cell sizes

- improve cell hud



- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC

- check side scrolling work correctly..like above HUD...seemed to zoom me out with brief testing...oh, but that was with an earlier live release on b33hive...check it anyway that it works well

- make sure of fast-click for snap links on mobile

- do pinch-zoom for touch devices

- fix highlight behavior for touch devices

- see about scroll wheel event and/or pinch zoom event for macbook



- do js animations, test on iPad, see if it's faster

- fix fast click

- test out scaled3d on iPad, chrome...try workaround where you still do it for low zooms on chrome?




- investigate background image of space or something

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.



- move "useful" text up a bit to line up with arrow...possible add at end "including things that make other things".

- get rid of sm prefix



- figure out swarm licensing

- make basic swarm readme
