- fix magnifier on touch devices

- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC

- do pinch-zoom

- investigate background image of space or something

- should be able to scroll over cell hud

- fix bug that causes snap to top-left corner when navigating to a url

- perhaps preallocate all the cells that I'll need for full zoomed-out view.
