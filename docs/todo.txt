- support larger focused cell sizes

- improve cell hud


- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC

- check side scrolling work correctly..like above HUD...seemed to zoom me out with brief testing...oh, but that was with an earlier live release on b33hive...check it anyway that it works well

- make sure of fast-click for snap links on mobile

- do pinch-zoom for touch devices

- fix highlight behavior for touch devices

- see about scroll wheel event and/or pinch zoom event for macbook

- fix click manager...do what google says





- investigate background image of space or something

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.





- browser navigator does not set title of page if you go directly to URL

- go through and format thumbnail descriptions

- move "useful" text up a bit to line up with arrow...possible add at end "including things that make other things".



- figure out swarm licensing
