- try trick where hud stays put until you move your mouse...complication is how to work with touches, both conceptually and technical distinguishing.

- rewrite history manager...example bug: do a direct snap to rose, click up, wait for snap complete...press back then up again before reaching rose and wait for snap complete to rose parent...notice that rose parent is now the base history state...stole it from rose




- total wishlist, but when you press up from a cell and go to the parent directory, the child's link is highlighted and the cell automatically scrolled to reach it

- might be not rendering cell_1s until the initial snap ends...coming from another domain

- visit home cell, do browser addy-bar navigation to new page, press back...home cell may not be popped soon enough (do slow snap speed).

- see if U_Servlet returned streams need to be closed or not

- still a little white border when snapping to strip cells (maybe others) i think...maybe slow down snap and see if it's easy to repro

- snap to a cell, put lag in getCode, call refresh, notice spinner, exit cell...spinner leaves

- lead slash on tab title

- focused cells resize to Min(screen size, cell size)




- perhaps have delay for actually showing the cell_1 loading animation...so for .5 seconds or whatever it's invisible then fades in real quick...this is to limit the jarring effect it has for most of the time when it's just appearing for a brief instant before the code is retrieved from server...on the other hand meta cells won't behave like this...they always have to show loading animation, so it would be inconsistent perhaps

-perhaps show higher metas that are already loaded when panning at cell_1 level and enough cells haven't loaded yet that maybe it makes sense to show a fuzzy preview for a second or two, instead of nothing.








- double-chcek gpu usage

- see if modifying display triggers reflow....see how many reflows per update we're doing...should just be one





- "Nothing in an explanation is more important than the words after 'for example'".

- logical argument to esp

- update resume





- don't hit server for cell sizes for interim/snap-adjacent cells while snapping...not a problem for my website for now cause everything's generated locally at start up.

- make it so focused spinner doesn't go off the bottom or right when all the way scrolled over with a really thin window...make it behave kinda like the cell hud does when it's totally collapsed down...kinda ghosts along the opposite direction of the scroll

- canvas backing scrolls with focused cell...not really a concern for now cause backing isn't visible under normal circumstances...only for debug for now

- maybe use some sparse int-key-based hashmap for getCellAtAbsCoord

- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)



- rewrite simple urls to their long ones

- 


- oar main picture is out of focus

- don't capture all touches for pressure

- first pressure has effect/affect typo

- slider doesn't work in decay for android or something.

- fix image caching for pressure, maybe decay

- snow flake ripples more pronounced and polar bear periodic ripples when still



- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes and building app

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell's code

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization

- detect platform capability (through fps or something) and accordingly skip meta levels and/or use lower rez meta images

- hud slightly too short on mobile browsers...no idea why...hacked for now to do mobile check and add one pixel but it don't make sense



- firefox tries to continuously load (at least showing favicon spinner) something for cells with iframes
