- support larger focused cell sizes ( be sure to include size for initial cell as sync transaction if there's an address in the browser bar).

- make sure to have force override for keeping viewed cell in buffer

- make cell hud expand with cell

- have scroll navigator account for cell expansion

- constrain snap in mouse navigator

- make sure retration time lines up with fade out time...any greater and cell might get lower z-index under surrounding cells as it's still retracting





- ipad doesn't handle device orientation changes...either crashes or shows scaled-up view

- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC

- check side scrolling works correctly..scroll padding isn't respected

- make sure of fast-click for snap links on mobile

- do pinch-zoom for touch devices

- fix highlight behavior for touch devices

- see about scroll wheel event and/or pinch zoom event for macbook

- fix fast click

- hud lags behind when touch scrolling

- for the "creations" cell, the link highlights itself briefly upon clicking, over the description box...might be fixed by fast click






- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
