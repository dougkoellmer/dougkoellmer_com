- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC



- check side scrolling work correctly..like above HUD...seemed to zoom me out with brief testing...oh, but that was with an earlier live release on b33hive...check it anyway that it works well

- make sure of fast-click for snap links on mobile

- do pinch-zoom for touch devices

- fix highlight behavior for touch devices

- see about scroll wheel event and/or pinch zoom event for macbook



- investigate background image of space or something

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.

- run home cell source through a formatter




- support larger focused cell sizes
