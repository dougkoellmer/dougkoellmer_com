- have hud disappear to the top



- rewrite history manager...example bug: do a direct snap to rose, click up, wait for snap complete...press back then up again before reaching rose and wait for snap complete to rose parent...notice that rose parent is now the base history state...stole it from rose

- check this post next release: still seems like on mobile that loaded cell_1s go white when you zoom out to cell_2/4/whatever...might be fixed now that meta doesn't use gpu...nothing to do if it still acts like that







- perhaps have delay for actually showing the cell_1 loading animation...so for .5 seconds or whatever it's invisible then fades in real quick...this is to limit the jarring effect it has for most of the time when it's just appearing for a brief instant before the code is retrieved from server...on the other hand meta cells won't behave like this...they always have to show loading animation, so it would be inconsistent perhaps










- double-chcek gpu usage

- see if modifying display triggers reflow....see how many reflows per update we're doing...should just be one







- logical argument to esp

- update resume





- don't hit server for cell sizes for interim/snap-adjacent cells while snapping...not a problem for my website for now cause everything's generated locally at start up.

- spinner lagged behind behind scroll at some point pretty significantly on Android...may be better since a lot of things changed there.

- hud appears fine and animates well before cells and focuser appear when going going between history states with different app sessions

- make it so focused spinner doesn't go off the bottom or right when all the way scrolled over with a really thin window...make it behave kinda like the cell hud does when it's totally collapsed down...kinda ghosts along the opposite direction of the scroll

- canvas backing scrolls with focused cell...not really a concern for now cause backing isn't visible under normal circumstances...only for debug for now

- maybe use some sparse int-key-based hashmap for getCellAtAbsCoord

- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)



- rewrite simple urls to their long ones

- 


- oar main picture is out of focus

- don't capture all touches for pressure

- first pressure has effect/affect typo

- slider doesn't work in decay for android or something.

- fix image caching for pressure, maybe decay

- snow flake ripples more pronounced and polar bear periodic ripples when still



- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes and building app

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell's code

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization

- detect platform capability (through fps or something) and accordingly skip meta levels and/or use lower rez meta images

- hud slightly too short on mobile browsers...no idea why...hacked for now to do mobile check and add one pixel but it don't make sense



- firefox tries to continuously load (at least showing favicon spinner) something for cells with iframes
