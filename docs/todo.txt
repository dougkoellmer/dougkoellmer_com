- have canvas backing draw loading animation

- populate grid ownership client-side...no embedded transaction...

- keep out of scope meta cells around for a frame or two...see if we can eliminate popping white of the cells to a degree

- maybe try to treat subcellcount based on the *target* position and not the current position in some cases...see if we can find some optimizations there




- make it so focused spinner doesn't go off the bottom or right when all the way scrolled over with a really thin window...make it behave kinda like the cell hud does when it's totally collapsed down...kinda ghosts along the opposite direction of the scroll

- canvas backing scrolls with focused cell...not really a concern for now cause backing isn't visible under normal circumstances...only for debug for now

- clean up transform function in VisualCellManager...recently became so that some variables are recalculated for every buffer every frame...instead of just once per frame

- use some sparse int-key-based hashmap for getCellAtAbsCoord

- delay hud zoom animation until cell is visible

- don't remove visual cell until it's done animating if it's still on screen

- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)



- rewrite simple urls to their long ones

- 


- oar main picture is out of focus

- don't capture all touches for pressure

- first pressure has effect/affect typo

- slider doesn't work in decay for android or something.

- fix image caching for pressure, maybe decay

- snow flake ripples more pronounced



- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes and building app

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell's code

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization




- firefox tries to load something with cells with iframes

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
