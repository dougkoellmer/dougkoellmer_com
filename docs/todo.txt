- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size




- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- shouldn't be hitting server for compiled /home cell...actually should be on direct address nav, but hmm...that's wasteful...at the least check that compiled is ignored




- firefox tries to keep loading something in embedded portfolio & resume




- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
