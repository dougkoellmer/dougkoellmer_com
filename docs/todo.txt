- fix magnifier on touch devices

- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC

- make sure of fast-click for snap links on mobile

- do pinch-zoom


- have initial zoom in for first page view

- investigate background image of space or something

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.

- run home cell source through a formatter

- increase area outside cell which can be used to scroll...for touch devives i think this is needed.
