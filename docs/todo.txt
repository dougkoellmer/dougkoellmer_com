- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size




- larger cell sizes don't align properly on direct address navigation

- cells next to resume on direct address navigation are greyed out.

- fix cell hud thing

- ie scroll bar appears under cell until resize or scroll...ie bug, but needs workaround...actually cause cell is fixed on focus gained somehow




- firefox tries to keep loading something in embedded portfolio & resume




- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.

- split panel resizer doesn't play nice with iframes
