- cell hud jumps when exiting a cell that has been scrolled to the right.

- resizing window inwards with rightmost scroll...hud ghosts away

- hud scroll doesn't work when it's larger than window size



- cell doesn't retract properly if there's a scroll value

- figure out why calcTargetLayout is called so many times

- think cell retraction needs easing

- cell doesn't line up well if window is less than 512 (probably) and cell is greater than 512.



- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size



- put compile target back to "all browsers"

- make sure retration time lines up with fade out time...any greater and cell might get lower z-index under surrounding cells as it's still retracting

- put split panel back to zero width




- ipad doesn't handle device orientation changes...either crashes or shows scaled-up view

- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC

- check side scrolling works correctly..scroll padding isn't respected

- do pinch-zoom for touch devices

- fix highlight behavior for touch devices

- see about scroll wheel event and/or pinch zoom event for macbook

- fix fast click

- hud lags behind when touch scrolling

- for the "creations" cell, the link highlights itself briefly upon clicking, over the description box...might be fixed by using click event

- see if there's any meta tag for preventing the spring scroll-past of the whole page.

- fix crashing when too many cells appear at once.






- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
