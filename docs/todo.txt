- cell hud jumps when exiting a cell that has been scrolled to the right.

- resizing window inwards with rightmost scroll...hud ghosts away

- hud scroll doesn't work when it's larger than window size

- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- have scroll work anywhere on focuser surface...so only a click can exit


- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size




- firefox tries to keep loading something in embedded portfolio




- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
