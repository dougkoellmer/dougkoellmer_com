- canvas seems to usually be off by one pixel to the upper left

- there's that one 4x4 in the preciouses branch that really goes off

- skip cells, both for canvas rendering and for buffer filling

- delay hud zoom animation until cell is visible

- don't remove visual cell until it's done animating if it's still on screen


- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history

- have mouse x/y pan not affect any possible zoom ease that's happening (should "fix" mac magic mouse jerky behavior)



- rewrite simple urls to their long ones

- 


- oar main picture is out of focus

- don't capture all touches for pressure

- first pressure has effect/affect typo

- slider doesn't work in decay for android or something.

- fix image caching for pressure, maybe decay

- snow flake ripples more pronounced



- have the development server reload called after generating cell sizes and building app

- image compisitor should pull cell size and grid size variables from java, and spacing/background color

- be able to refresh single cell's code

- have cell flag for whether content should refresh itself on focus lost...optimization




- firefox tries to load something with cells with iframes

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
