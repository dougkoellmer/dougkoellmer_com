- preserve aspect ratios on expansion/retraction

- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size


- ie 10 iframes go over scroll bars and mess up history


- firefox tries to load something with cells with iframes

- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
