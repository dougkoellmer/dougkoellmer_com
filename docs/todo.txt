- cell hud jumps when exiting a cell that has been scrolled to the right.

- resizing window inwards with rightmost scroll...hud ghosts away

- hud scroll doesn't work when it's larger than window size


- figure out what loading will look like with focused cell size



- do thumbnail addition on server



- tooltips don't work on embedded resume




- make sure holding and dragging a bunch of cells off screen isn't too much of a performance impact...do GC only when stopping moving.
