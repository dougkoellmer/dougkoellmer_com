- ipad doesn't handle device orientation changes...either crashes or shows scaled-up view

- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving, IIRC

- check side scrolling works correctly..scroll padding isn't respected

- do pinch-zoom for touch devices

- fix highlight behavior for touch devices

- see about scroll wheel event and/or pinch zoom event for macbook

- fix fast click

- hud lags behind when touch scrolling

- for the "creations" cell, the link highlights itself briefly upon clicking, over the description box...might be fixed by using click event

- see if there's any meta tag for preventing the spring scroll-past of the whole page.

- fix crashing when too many cells appear at once.
