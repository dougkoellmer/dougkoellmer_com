- make touch-click tolerance a little more forgiving

- check side scrolling works correctly..scroll padding isn't respected

- do pinch-zoom for touch devices

- fix fast click

- for the "creations" cell, the link highlights itself briefly upon clicking, over the description box...might be fixed by using click event



- fix highlight behavior for touch devices

- see about scroll wheel event and/or pinch zoom event for macbook track pad



- hud lags behind when touch scrolling



- see if there's any meta tag for preventing the spring scroll-past of the whole page on iOS

- focused cells get selected pretty easily on android while touching down and pausing for a scroll or something...same as a normal page though i guess so maybe shouldn't worry about it

- can't scroll iframes in iOS

- iOS doesn't scroll smoothly...can't fling

- rotate on ipad...layout updates itself several times pretty sloppily...maybe getting several intermediate resize events and we should just key off the last one?
