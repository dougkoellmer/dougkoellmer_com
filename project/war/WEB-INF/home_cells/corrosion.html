<div class='dk_list_title'>Background</div><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was the programming lead on a game whose purpose is to teach how metal corrosion 
works, ways to protect against it (large scale), and the fiscal (also sometimes dangerous) impact of not taking 
corrosion into account when designing and maintaining large structures.  As a result of my position I had to 
teach myself a lot about corrosion theory.  Although we regularly consulted with some of the foremost experts 
in the world, they can only take you so far.  Talking with them sometimes, it's like a brain surgeon trying to 
explain things to a first-year medical student; there's knowledge to be passed on, but the student has no 
framework for receiving it.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm writing this to hopefully offer a simple explanation for the layman about how 
corrosion works.  Keep in mind that this explanation concerns only metal corrosion.  Also keep in mind that it's 
a very general explanation.  If you want to know more, go get a doctorate in Chemistry.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>Introduction</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corrosion is usually erroneously described by its results; rust, oxidation, pitting, 
etc.  It's important to recognize the fact that corrosion itself is a microscopic process independent of 
anything it produces.  In general it is defined as the <i>act</i> of the degradation of metal due to 
interaction with its surroundings.  In essence, corrosion changes steel (or other engineered metals) into a 
substance that no longer has the same desired properties, e.g. strength, toughness, flexibility, etc.  It can 
actually be thought of as the reverse process of producing steel in the first place.  To make steel, you mine 
iron oxide, introduce large amounts of energy (heat) to separate the iron from the oxygen, then add carbon to 
technically make it steel.  But iron (steel, whatever, same thing) is actually an unstable little element.  
Being now in a relatively high-energy state, it will naturally seek to revert back to its more stable iron oxide 
form if left to its own devices.  In fact, iron by itself hardly exists <i>anywhere</i> naturally on the surface 
of the Earth!<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in short, remember, nature doesn't like high-energy states (<a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics" target=_blank>see Entropy/Second Law of 
Thermodynamics</a>).  A glass of milk on a table prefers to be on the floor.  Iron and other engineered metals 
are in a high-energy state, and so they have a tendency to return to a low-energy state; they do this through 
corrosion.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>Going Deeper</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above is a broad definition though.  Going deeper, (breathe in) corrosion is an 
electrochemical process arising from a electrical potential difference between two pieces of metal, connected by 
an electrically conductive path (usually this means they are simply touching each other).  Further, both metals 
must be in contact with an electrolyte (e.g. salt water) capable of spurring chemical interactions with the two 
metals, which in turn causes them to exchange electrons.  This exchange of electrons implies an electrical 
current, also called the corrosion current.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above paragraph describes what is <i>essential</i> for corrosion to occur.  In 
other words, you need (a) two metals with a potential difference, (b) an electrical path from one to the other, 
and (c) an electrolyte that interacts with the metals to produce an electrical current between the two.  Take 
away just one of these and corrosion does not happen.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collectively, (a), (b), and (c) are referred to as a corrosion cell.  A corrosion cell 
generally has very little physical analogue to real life, but rather is a tool for abstraction, so that 
corrosion is easier to visualize. It's kind of like in high school how your science teacher shows you these 
models of atoms, with concentric rings surrounding a giant nucleus.  If you do any kind of further study, you 
know atoms look nothing like that (indeed, atoms are too small to even "look" at in the first place!).  A 
corrosion cell diagram is a very similar tool.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>The Corrosion Cell</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But anyway, let's go a little deeper into the individual parts of a corrosion cell 
(CC), starting with the two metals.  In the context of a CC, they are referred to as electrodes.  The anode is 
the metal that corrodes, and (to put it simply) the cathode is the metal that doesn't.  Which metal is the anode 
is determined by its electrical potential relative to the other metal.  The metal that has a more negative 
potential will become anodic and corrode.  Below is an abridged list of metals called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_series" target=_blank>Galvanic Series</a>, with Gold near the top being the most "corrosion resistant", or "least active" metal.  Therefore, if you put iron and copper 
together in a corrosion cell, iron would corrode because it's the more active (more electrically negative) metal 
of the two.  Further, the distance between two metals on the series determines how fast corrosion will occur.  
So coupled together, gold would cause iron to corrode much faster than would copper.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron and copper is sort of the "classic" corrosion cell configuration, and in fact 
modern study of corrosion was brought about when iron nails were used to fix copper sheathing in place on the 
Royal Navy Frigate HMS Alarm in the late 18th century.  Guess what happened when iron, copper, and sea water 
were mixed together. The nails were damn near vaporized and so most of the sheathing fell off in no time.  The 
only pieces that remained were those that had been fixed in place by nails that still had the paper from their 
packaging lodged underneath their heads, thus electrically separating them from the copper.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another classic corrosion cell is the dry cell battery.  Yes, every Duracell you've 
ever used depends on corrosion to produce its electrical current.  To relate it to the corrosion cell model, a 
battery typically uses zinc as the anode, graphite (carbon) as the cathode, a special electrolytic "paste" to spur the 
reactions, and the circuits in the device you're powering act as the electrical return path.  So if the battery 
isn't being used, one part of the corrosion cell is eliminated and so no corrosion occurs inside.  A battery 
"dies" when all the zinc is corroded.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>Other Corrosion Cells</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A potential difference between two metals can occur for many other reasons than just 
the inherent properties of the metals.  Temperature differences can play a big role.  In a corrosion cell, the 
higher temperature electrode, even if its metal composition is the same as the other electrode, can become 
anodic.  This is of importance in heating systems, where pipes close to the heater will have a tendency to 
corrode because they have a more negative electrical potential compared to the pipes further down the line.  This kind of cell is called a 
differential temperature corrosion cell.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also have a differential aeration cell, where one electrode is exposed to more 
oxygen or nitrogen, and a differential concentration cell, where one electrode is exposed to a different 
concentration of electrolyte than the other.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these circumstances, and more, can lead to a potential difference between the 
electrodes, which is the driving force behind corrosion.  If there's no potential difference, there's no 
corrosion.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>But, Wait...</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you've actually continued reading this far, you may be saying to yourself, "Wait, 
most of the rust I see every day is on just one ordinary piece of metal, like that old hammer in my garage.  It 
certainly isn't touching any copper, and one side isn't hotter than the other.  So what gives?"  This kind of 
corrosion is surprisingly no different than what's described above.  It is brought about by what are called 
Local Action Corrosion Cells.  Microscopic impurities on the surface of the iron lead to millions of very slight 
potential differences, which in turn leads to millions of tiny corrosion cells.  If you think about a sandbox, 
even if the sand is completely level to the naked eye, up close, some grains will be higher than other grains, 
and therefore have slightly more gravitational potential energy.  It's somewhat the same case with a metal's 
surface, except we're talking about electrical potential.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a real life example of this, most knives have a "grain" in their steel perpendicular 
to the edge.  You'll notice that on old knives, you can sometimes see a rust pattern form along these grains, 
with rust appearing in the valleys, because these valleys form the anodic (more active) regions of the local 
action corrosion cells.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example, kind of, is that well-polished steel has less of a tendency to 
corrode.  This is because you're eliminating most of the "impurities" on the surface of the metal, so it's 
harder for corrosion cells to develop.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>How Do We Stop It</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mankind has known about corrosion ever since we made the momentous switch from stone to 
metal.  It's an interesting historical side note that our discovery and use of metal follows the Galvanic Series  very closely.  Gold was the first 
metal used by man about 12,000 years ago because it exists in its metallic form in nature.  Copper (bronze = 
copper + tin) is more easily corroded but can also be found in its elemental form in nature, and so started to 
be used about 10,000 years ago for tools and weapons. Iron wasn't isolated until about 3,500 years ago because 
it requires sophisticated technology to smelt (separate from oxygen).  Zinc is even further down the series and 
wasn't discovered until the 16th century because of how difficult it is to produce.  Sodium is explosively 
reactive with water and so wasn't isolated until the late 19th century.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We didn't have much problems keeping Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc. in good shape.  For the 
most part, these metals require special conditions to corrode to the point where they become unusable.  Iron was 
our first big maintenance challenge, and up to about a few hundred years ago, the only real strategy to prevent 
corrosion was constant TLC (tender, loving care).  You had to keep your iron-based implements polished, oiled, 
and out of the elements if you expected them to last any length of time.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>Passivation</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point however we came up with several great ways to slow down steel/iron 
corrosion.  The first was by alloying steel with chromium to create stainless steel.  Unlike iron, when chromium corrodes, its oxide (chromium oxide) takes up the same volume as the chromium itself, and therefore has a tendency to form a passive film on its surface that in fact prevents corrosion from penetrating deeper into its structure.  This is why stainless steel is known for its corrosion resistance, but it's not the steel that's doing the resisting, it's the chromium.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the galvanic series, you can see that aluminum is way down there, and so seemingly very corrosion 
prone as well.  But just like chromium, aluminum tends to create a passive aluminum oxide layer on its surface 
very quickly, and so in practice it can be very corrosion resistant despite its high activity on paper.  Just 
look at soda cans.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>Coating</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone also had the bright idea at some point to coat steel with corrosion resistant 
paint or seal it in rubber.  These methods have and will continue to become more and more effective, though they 
have obvious limitations for many purposes.  The idea behind a coating of course is to cut off the electrolyte 
component of the corrosion cell, just like passivation.<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>Others</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other strategies for preventing corrosion, but most work off the same 
principle as the above two, so on to the mother...<br><br><br>


<div class='dk_list_title'>Cathodic Protection</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passivation and coating are fine when you're talking about your tools or your car, but 
what about if you want to protect a whole bridge, or building, from corroding?  Although it can sometimes be 
done, using passivating metals (e.g. stainless steel) and coatings can be costly and inefficient.  But if you 
have an understanding of how corrosion works, you can really nip it in the butt by pulling a fast one on nature. 
 Let's say you have a large freighter whose steel hull is corroding due to local action cells.  Your corrosion 
cell diagram for this case will have iron for both its electrodes, with the corrosion current being pushed by 
the small potential difference because of the impurities in the steel's iron.  So what if you replaced one electrode 
with a metal that was guaranteed to be more electronegative (more active) than the most active regions of the 
iron itself?<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is exactly what corrosion engineers do.  They literally slap huge blocks of 
magnesium (for example) onto the hull of the ship.  The magnesium then corrodes preferentially to the iron.  
Therefore the term "Cathodic Protection" can in other words be taken to mean "Protecting a Metal by Turning it 
into a Cathode".  Thus you are sacrificing the more active (and conveniently usually cheaper) metal to save the 
other metal.  This method of cathodic protection is unsurprisingly called Sacrificial CP.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other method of Cathodic Protection is called Impressed Current CP.  Fundamentally it's the same as 
Sacrificial CP, but instead of using a more active metal to act as the anode, the anode is <i>simulated</i> 
using an outside power source.  Instead of the anode of the cell being more electronegative than the cathode 
(the iron/steel) by virtue of its own inherit properties, a power source sort of forces a current onto the 
corrosion cell that makes it "think" that the anode is more negative.  In this situation the "anode" doesn't 
even really corrode, and in fact can have a much higher electrical potential than the cathode.  As long as the power stays on, an impressed current system can protect a structure almost 
indefinitely.  By contrast, a sacrificial system only lasts as long as the metal you are 
sacrificing.<br><br><br>
