<div class="dk_longform_title">A true story from my time in Poland...</div>

<br>

<div align="left">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a Wednesday morning in Szczecin, Poland, the year of our lord 2007.  My girlfriend's birthday is that weekend.  As a sort of gag gift, I want to make her a backscratcher because she's always asking me to scratch her back (I'm an expert).  We live together in the city center so there's really no tree branches I can go around cutting off without pissing someone off.  So I take the day off from work, hop on a tram, and travel to the last stop, 45 minutes outside the city, no man's land.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a typical cold, gray, misty, communist-looking winter day, and the primeval Eastern European forest I'm now facing exaggerates those surreal qualities.  I enter along a deer path and instantly the forest swallows me.  20 meters in and I can't even look back and see the tram through the tendrils of fog.  Enraptured by my surroundings, I walk along, forgetting about my goal for now.  Peace envelops me.  After about 10 minutes, as I'm picking my way through some overhanging branches, a flutter of muted color in the otherwise stark scape draws my eye to an old man making his slow way along a path parallel to mine, perhaps 50 meters off.  His form ebbs and flows with the blanketing fog, cane almost floating along like a stunted sapling come to life, until his path diverges from mine and he disappears completely.<br><br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation leaves me a bit irritated.  Not only is the solitude of the walk temporarily broken, but knowing that he is around means I have to be careful; Polish people, especially the old-timers, are notoriously anal about their forests, and while I would be sure to take a piece of wood that wouldn't do any permanent damage, chances are that me with a saw near a tree wouldn't go over well.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I shrug it off and continue my walk, starting to look for good candidates for backscratcher stock.  I come upon a small pond and amuse myself by skipping some stones.  As this pastime always prompts me to do, I start thinking...what was an old man doing out in this weather in the middle of nowhere?  Did I even see him, or was it my imagination?  Am I on something?  My musings are broken by a hunched form hobbling along on the other side of the pond.  I look to his face and it's another old man, staring right back at me as he walks, a predator-like lust gleaming in his eyes that I can't even begin to make sense of.  From his look, for whatever disturbing reason, it's pretty obvious that he intends to come around the pond to me.  It will take him a few minutes though so I'm off and I lose him in the fog.<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pace is unconsciously a little brisker now.  Forget the relaxing walk, I just want to get a piece of wood and get back to the tram.  I stop at a patch of silvery maples, ethereal in the subdued morning light, and my lust for a good piece of wood brings me back to my senses.  What am I doing letting some old geezers freak me out?  I'm a young, strong guy, with a hacksaw and a knife no less if shit goes down.  My confident rant is sundered by the snap of a wet twig behind me. <i>Impossible</i>...but yes, it's yet ANOTHER old man, a few dozen meters away, making his way towards me.  I tell myself fuck this and walk right at him.  I don't really know what I intended, but he makes a small whimper, turns around, and shambles off as fast as he can. <i>What the FUCK?!?!</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to myself.  I have no idea what's going on, but I don't like it, so after making sure nobody's around now I cut off the first decent branch I find.  It's not the best, a little knotty, but I'll make it work.  I make a beeline for the tram straight through the woods, not bothering with paths.  It's about 20 minutes away...I only make it 5.<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's almost not even a surprise when yet another dirty old man separates himself from some tall bushes in front of me.  There's no escape this time, and besides, my curiosity is getting the best of me...what the hell could these guys possibly want???  Turns out the answer to that is something best left in those woods.  His Polish is very rough and colloquial as he asks me a question, and so I don't quite understand.  Did I hear the slang for "dick" in there?...nah, can't be.  I say "Czego?", "What?", a rude request for him to repeat.  This time he uses body language to help convey his meaning.  In slow motion, his hand reaches out, grasping, with my crotch being the only possible target within miles.  Fueled by horror, my reactions have never been so fast.  Right before his grubby little hand makes contact I swat his wrist away with one arm and push his body away with the other.  A playful, toothless grin splits his face as he stumbles back, like I'm playing hard to get.  "Nie zainteresowany", "Not interested" I say, and my gruff tone says I mean it.  I practically run back to the tram.<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting at the stop some time later, I'm starting to feel a little better.  At the least I'll have a great story to tell over drinks that night.  I'm still a little confused about the old guys though...do they just hook up out there with each other and I just happened to be some fresh meat that stumbled into their lair?  The tram rolling up out of the distance is a blessed interruption to my disturbing reverie.  At this remote stop, in the middle of a weekday, it's a little surprising that there's anyone even on it, but when the doors open up a guy steps out that could be my brother; normal-looking, mid-twenties, clean cut...uncannily even matching my jeans and hoodie outfit.  <i>No way</i>, I think.  But sure enough, as I look out the back window of the departing tram, I see him furtively enter the woods and disappear.<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last piece of the puzzle falls into place.
