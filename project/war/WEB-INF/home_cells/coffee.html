<div class="dk_longform_title">The perfect cup of coffee...</div>

<br><u>Background</u>:<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee is a passion of mine.  I celebrate it in all its various forms - Dripped, Perculated, Steeped, Latte, Capuccino, Turkish, Espresso, I'll suck 'em all down.  However I've found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target=_blank>French Press</a> method to be the best combination of easy, cheap, and delicious.  However there's still a lot involved in consistently achieving that absolutely perfect cup that will make everything else in life fade away for a bit.

<br><br><br><u>Equipment</u>:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kettle (preferably glass), Burr Coffee Grinder (optional), Wooden Spoon, French Press<br><br>

<br><u>General&nbsp;Tips</u>:<br>

		<ul>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Nothing should touch any plastic at any point. The only substances that should ever come in contact, in order of inertness and preference, are glass, ceramic, or metal that forms a passive oxide layer (stainless steel, aluminum, etc.).</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Use a normal ceramic mug preheated by microwaving it full of water. Don't use steel or plastic thermal mugs. They have a tendency to 'cook' the coffee, giving it a burnt taste after a while.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Quality of water is equally important to the quality of bean.  Use the cleanest, coldest, tastiest water you can get for brewing.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Reheating coffee can really kill its taste.  So if you like it hot and want to savour every drop then drink fast.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>The more cups of coffee you drink in a day, the worse it will start to taste.  Have just one cup a day to maximize flavor.  Also, although studies are very contradictory at this point, coffee probably isn't the healthiest thing you can put into your body.  So drink in moderation.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Coffee beans/grounds oxidize and los freshness pretty quickly, so you have to do all you can to keep them from going stale.  Store in a mason jar in your cabinet or other dark place at room temperature.  Make sure of a tight seal.  Don't refrigerate.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Freshly grinding your own beans will always yield better results than using pre-ground coffee.  Beans store better too; less surface area, slower oxidation rate.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Brand and roast preference vary widely, but Starbucks currently offers a 'Reserve' line of single-origin coffees that are quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with any of the roasts or origins in my opinion.</li>
		</ul>

	<br><u>French&nbsp;Press&nbsp;Tips</u>:<br>

		<ul>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>You need one heaping tablespoon of grounds for every 2 cups of water.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>French presses are not all made equal.  <a href="http://www.bodum.com" target=_blank>Bodum</a> makes the best that I've used. Some things to look for are that the glass is thick and sturdy, and that there's no plastic parts, at least none that will come in direct contact with the coffee.  My reservations about plastic notwithstanding, it's very hard to clean the coffee gunk off of.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>No matter how careful you are, the glass of your press will get microscopic scratches and kinks in it that will exaggerate themselves over time, and eventually the glass will break due to temperature differentials or accidental impact.  Treat every time as the time it will break.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>You may want to coarsely grind your beans (or get them coarsely ground) so that they don't go through the plunger mesh.  Otherwise you'll get some mud at the bottom of your cup.  Not a big deal though.</li>
		</ul>

	<br><u>Preparation</u>:<br>
	
	<ol>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Bring water to boil in a clean kettle.  A typical press holds about 5 (measuring) cups, which is 2-4 (drinking) cups, depending on preference.  Always put a little extra water in the kettle to account for steam loss.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>If you're grinding your coffee, unseal the beans and do a coarse grind (consult your coffee grinder instructions) then immediately reseal your beans.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Right before the water starts to boil drop coffee grounds into the bottom of your press (1 heaping tablespoon for every 2 cups water).  Immediately seal up and store away your grounds/beans if necessary.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Let the water sit for 30 seconds or so after it boils.  Exact temperature varies based on all kinds of things and your coffee bag might show the "dialed-in" temperature you should use, but 190&#176;-200&#176;F is a good range to target. Generally you want it steaming but not still bubbling, as that can 'overextract' and give the coffee a bitter, burnt taste.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Pour the water onto the grounds.  Remember that if your press has a kink or scratch in it (and it will eventually), the sudden addition of near boiling water can cause it to break.  So make it a practice to put the press in a sink or something before you fill it.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Stir the grounds a bit with a wooden spoon, then put the top on the press and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Push down the plunger and pour the coffee into preheated mugs.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Immediately take the plunger out and rinse with water.  If you let it sit in the dregs it will get stained and gunked and will be much harder to clean later.  Rinse and clean the glass with warm soapy water as soon as you can, but don't do so until the glass cools a bit, as the sudden temperature change can, again, cause breakage.</li>
			<li class='dk_coffee_list_entry'>Drink it black with a glass of cold water between sips and perhaps a piece of dark chocolate. If you've followed all the above steps your coffee should be delicious by itself. The only reason most people think they don't like black coffee is because they drink shit coffee.</li>
