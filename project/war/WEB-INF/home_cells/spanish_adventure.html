<div class="dk_longform_title">A true story from my first weekend living in Spain...</div>

<br>

<div class="">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's June, the summer after graduating college and I'm not really sure what I want to do with the rest of my life.  The only thing I know is that I can't stay in America, can't do the normal office job thing that my computer science major would have of me.  I decide to travel somewhere, anywhere, and stay there.  The easiest way I can see to do that is by becoming an English Teacher, and to be an English Teacher overseas you need a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Lanaguage) certificate.  I book an intensive month-long course in Sevilla, Spain for September.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm coming off a break-up with my girlfriend in the spring, so to occupy my mind I dive into work moving furniture, taking every job that I can.  It can pay up to $3000 a month, so by September I should have enough money saved to pay for the course, plane ticket, etc.  I plan on getting a job in Spain pretty soon after that too.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September is a long time coming though.  Days are filled with moving furniture and nights are filled with working on my <a href="javascript:dk.snap('guitar_case')" target=_blank>guitar case</a>.  Finally, the long-anticipated day arrives and I find myself on a plane over the Atlantic.  My adventure begins.  I get into Sevilla on a Friday night.  A TEFL representative picks me up at the airport and drives me to the apartment that I'll be sharing with 3 other students (all three turn out to be girls, ugh).  It's late and my roommates are already asleep so I hit the hay.  Classes don't start until Monday, so for the next two days all the 20 someodd students doing the program meet up and we do the usual get to know each other thing over meals and drinks.  There are a bunch of cool people in the class and it looks like it'll turn out to be a really fun month.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday (well, 1:00AM Monday morning) finds me laying in bed a bit antsy, anxious over the next day of class.  I can't get to sleep.  I'm also a bit hungry, so with my American mindset of 24-hour stores being open I go out to find a bite to eat.  After about an hour though it's clear that everything's closed up tight.  Not even a gas station or anything is open.  Discouraged, I start back home.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly from across the street I hear an American-accented "Perd&#243;neme! &#191;Hablas ingl&#233;s?"  I look across the street and see two attractive women, late-20's, just coming out of a Hostel.  I say, "Yea, sure."  A kind of relieved look comes across their faces, like they haven't met any native English speakers in a while.  I expect them to ask for directions or something, but coincidentally they ask me if there's anywhere to get something to eat at this hour.  I laugh and tell them what I'm looking for, which breaks the ice for the usual "where are you from, what are you doing in Spain" conversation.  They're two friends from America, a blonde Amanda and a brunette Stacy, who decided to quit their jobs and live it up backpacking through Spain.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a nice conversation and are about to go our separate ways when a souped up beamer comes rolling up to the curb with a "machismo" Spaniard leaning out the window.  The two girls suddenly get all giddy and excited and go to talk to the guy.  They seem to kind of forget about me so I turn to leave.  But after just a few steps Amanda yells, "Hey, this guy knows where we can get some food.  Let's go, hop in!"  They could kind of sense my hesitation.  2:00AM, Monday morning, foreign country, strange guy.  They alleviate my fears with "Don't worry! We met him at a bar last night."  I'm like <i>Oh, well then</i>, but I say fuck it and jump in anyway.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 minutes later, waaay outside the city center, and I'm starting to get a little freaked out.  The brunette is pretty fluent in Spanish so she's chatting away with the driver up front.  I'm in the backseat talking with Amanda.  I ask again how they know this guy.  "Oh we met him at a bar last night.  He bought us drinks and we danced with him a bit.  He's actually a really famous Opera singer."  I'm like <i>yea, right</i>.  She can see the skepticism on my face, so instantly she interrupts the front-seat conversation and tells the guy to sing something.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few minutes are the most memorable of the evening despite the things that will happen later.  He sings Sinatra's version of "Stangers in the Night" and then "O Sole Mio", both all the way through (while driving mind you).  Until that point in my life I had no concept of how much a single human voice could so affect a person.  I mean I've heard recordings of great singers, some live concerts, and they're all good, whatever, but hearing a true professional (someone I'm soon to find out gets paid BIG bucks) from a few feet away, no microphones or sound systems between us...well, there's no comparison.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he finishes the second song I'm sitting there in a shocked stupor.  Amanda has that "I told you so" look on her face.  I concede.  There's still the matter of where the hell we're going though, cause we're really in the middle of nowhere now.  My question is answered when we pull up to an ornate iron gate.  A few punches on a numberpad and it swings open, the driveway leading us to a mansion on a hillside overlooking the whole of Sevilla.  As I get out of the car and take in my surroundings, I'm ready to wake up from this crazy dream.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dream it is not.  He leads us on a short tour through his immense house.  If there was any doubt about this guy being a legitimate singer, that's way out the window now.  I've moved furniture from some pretty nice houses before, but this guy's place is on a whole new level.  He takes us into this huge kitchen to deliver on his promise of food.  He opens up a walk-in fridge, comes back out with two slabs of steak, and throws them on this Japanese-style cooking surface.  While that's going, he breaks out a bottle of Scotch and pours us all a few fingers.  Saying it went down like iced-tea would be an insult to its quality - I didn't even know liquor could taste like that.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we devour the steak (and the whole bottle of scotch), he asks something in Spanish.  I hear the word swimming in there, and both the girls get excited and nod their heads.  The idiot that I am, I say "But I didn't bring a bathing suit."  They all kind of laugh at me and drag me outside.  <i>Oh ok, the guy has suits for us</i>, I think.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no.  Instead, all three of them proceed to get completely naked.  I'm just kind of standing there with a dumb look on my face.  The guy looks at me and motions me to strip down.  The scotch warm in my belly, what the hell.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all jump in the pool but it's freezing.  Perhaps to avoid "shrinkage", the guy pretty quickly suggests that we move to his jacuzzi.  We all pile in.  Amanda is sitting across from me.  We're flirting and she's looking pretty good at this point, so I start rubbing her feet and legs.  She approves.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Stacy and the Opera guy go to "get towels" in his room.  Amanda looks at me.  "Can I kiss you?", she asks.  "Of course", I say.  The next hour is censored in case kids are reading.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Amanda and I are lounging in the jacuzzi when Stacy and opera man finally return with those towels.  It's apparent that the night is kind of winding down at this point, so he offers to drive us back to the city center (he probably wants us gone now too).  It's a sleepy car ride back.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 8:00AM finally finds me back at the apartment after a quick espresso at a nearby cafe to keep me awake.  My three roommates are just on their way out for the 9:00AM class.  I run upstairs, grab my books, and join up without missing a beat.  They give me some strange looks, like "Where the hell have you been", but I'm still letting the whole experience sink in, so I leave the story for later after class.  And then of course nobody believes me when I tell it.  But hell, I wouldn't believe it either.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never heard from the two girls again.  We exchanged e-mail addresses but you know how that goes.  As for the guy, I didn't think about his name until the next day, at which point I couldn't remember it for the life of me.  I think there was a Domingo in there, but he definitely wasn't Pl&#225;cido Domingo.  In any case, it was the first of many fun times in Spain.<br><br>
