		"Get rid of insurance companies and let government do it. Start with car insurance to test the idea. Total up the cost for all car accidents at the end of the tax year, add some padding to pay for agency overhead, and distribute cost evenly to all drivers. You can do fancy things like weighting a person’s tax burden based on driving history or demographics or what have you but the core premise is so simple a 5-year-old can understand it. The cost per person would be lower and based on actual after-the-fact accident damages, not whatever crystal ball statistical models insurance companies use to predict the future. You also wouldn’t have a select coterie getting insanely rich while contributing nothing to society besides annoying commercials.",
		"Vote With Taxes",
		"Voting-based democracy is fundamentally broken. Looking at the state and national levels in most countries - well, if you don’t agree then there’s nothing I can say to persuade you so can stop reading now. And even at its ideal like a small town where everyone is intimate with the issues and candidates it’s mob rule with little influence by the populace between voting cycles. I propose a partial solution: let people vote with their taxes. On every tax return there’s a big checklist that lets an individual distribute 50% of their tax burden to whatever government programs they choose. Anti-war? Well don’t give the military money. Politicians and their puppet masters can keep playing treehouse with the other 50%.",
		"Pay For Speeding",
		"Speed limit enforcement on highways doesn’t seem effective and statistics on the Autobahn serve as a compelling argument to that effect. That’s not to say that letting people drive as fast as they want is without cost, but there’s a better way to manage it than paying cops to play Angry Birds in their patrol cars half the day. You grab a ticket when you enter a highway and slip the ticket into a machine when you exit. A familiar enough system to most except that this machine calculates how fast you drove based on the ticket’s timestamps and charges you accordingly. If you went the speed *recommendation* then there’s little or maybe no charge. If you went twice that then you pay accordingly but still much less than a speeding ticket. The system could also adjust for weather conditions so that 10 MPH over on a snowy day is a higher toll than on a sunny one."
